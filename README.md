## Game description
Welcome to our SUD word game Shinobi! In this game you will act as a ninja, and explore a variety of events(You might get some powerful jutsu or get some bad luck event, so be careful!). The board is 10X10 and once you kill enough monsters to get to level 3, you can challenge the boss. There are also health areas where you can fully recover your health point and mana. You will also experience some random events and elite monsters.

## Game building
This game was built by Calvin Vu and Hanxiao Mao in two weeks. During those two weeks, we used pair programming to complete the whole game from scratch, and write docstring for each of the functions. The functions are separated into modules, which are easy to build add-on functions and maintain. We also use doctest and unittest to check the function performance and quality. We really enjoy those two weeks and we hope you can enjoy the game. Cheers!
