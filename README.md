## Game building
This game was built by Calvin Vu and Hanxiao Mao in two weeks. During this two weeks, we used pair programming to complete the whole game from scratch, and write docstring for each of the functions. The functions are seperated into modules, which are easy to build add-on funcitons and maintain. We also use doctest and unittest to check the function performance and quality. We pretty enjot that two weeks and we hope you can enjoy the game. Cheers!
